# farm

One of my first Java programs: a farm game!

I actually rewrote this recently for fun, and to refresh my Java knowledge. I even added a Github Action to create a jar file artifact. You can see the old code on the other branch. It's pretty entertaining to read, as it was written when I was just learning programming.
